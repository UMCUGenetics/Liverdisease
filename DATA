Publicly available datasets:
Variant call format (VCF) files and surveyed bed files of healthy liver ASCs were downloaded from 
  https://wgs11.op.umcutrecht.nl/mutational_patterns_ASCs/.
WGS data of previously published samples was obtained from EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home) 
  accession number EGAD00001001900.
We downloaded 40 available H3K36me3 ChIP-Seq datasets from UCSC (https://genome.ucsc.edu/).
A list of cosmic cancer genes was obtained from https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/census.
Signatures v3 (and v2) were obtained from https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures.
